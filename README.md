# Simple 3D wormhole project
This project is being created to do a simple wormhole simulator.
Please do not expected anything incredible from here. It's a simple project and will be made the better I can in the space of time I have until the time I got to do so passes away(probably 2 weeks).
Any kind of math you can find in wikipedia and babylonjs documentation.

<br>
My propose isn't doing anything great and big, but useful and fast since I don't have much time.

### To do
1. Finish wormhole physics
2. Add the rest of the solar system
3. Try to improve performance
4. Manipulate Astros(CRUD for astros during runtime)
5. Show to my friends

<br>
Obs: the reason for the project to be called 'school-physics' it's because the project is beig requested to be used on my school's science fair
